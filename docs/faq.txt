      lightweight data management system for single molecule
      localization microscopy.

What is B-Store?
================

B-Store is a lightweight data management and analysis library for
single molecule localization microscopy (SMLM). It serves two primary
roles:

    1. To organize SMLM data inside a database for fast and easy
       information retrieval and storage.
    2. To facilitate the analysis of high content SMLM datasets.

What problem does B-Store solve?
--------------------------------

High content SMLM experiments can produce hundreds or even thousands
of files containing multiple types of data (images, raw localizations,
acquisition information, etc.). B-Store automatically sorts and stores
this information in a database for rapid retrieval and analysis,
removing any need to manually maintain the data yourself.

What are the design criteria for B-Store?
-----------------------------------------

To realize these roles, B-Store is designed to meet these important
criteria:

    + Experimental datasets must be combined into a database-like
      structure that is easily readable by both humans and computers.
    + Access and processing of data must be fast, regardless of the
      size of the dataset.
    + Data provenance must be preserved throughout the organization
      and analysis pipeline.
    + B-Store should not enforce standards that force scientists to
      adopt file formats, naming conventions, or software packages
      that differ from the ones they already use, except when it is
      absolutely necessary to achieve its roles.
    + B-Store should be extensible to adapt to the changing needs of
      scientists using SMLM.
    + Above all else, B-Store should make it easy to organize and
      document data and analysis pipelines to improve the
      reproducibility of SMLM experiments.

Of course, the changing needs of scientists means that B-Store will
always be evolving to meet these criteria.

What doesn't B-Store do?
------------------------

B-Store is efficient and fast because its scope is limited to SMLM
data organization and analysis. In particular, B-Store does not:

    + Calculate localizations from raw images.
    + Control microscopy hardware.
    + Provide database-like storage for core facilities.
    + Generate any data or results for you. (Sorry.)

How do I use B-Store?
